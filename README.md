# Firewood

Firewood parses Kindle's "My Clippings.txt" and outputs text files, organized by title.

Useful if you want to be able to skim through the best bits of books you've already read and highlighted. Could also be used with `grep` or some similar search tool to find a particular term in a book.

Firewood will create a directory called `Kindle Clippings` and will save all text files there.

## Fork (robert7)
####
Just very minor modification to enable easy text editor postprorcessing.


## Update: New version (written in Python)

**UPDATE (2015-04-06):** I've rewritten Firewood in Python. The new version is `pyrewood.py`. You can run it as a script by putting it in the same directory as your `My Clippings.txt` and doing `python pyrewood.py` from the terminal.

Run it by executing `./firewood`.
